          <h2>About Us</h2>

            necessary vaccination access sites to ensure they, along with their

          </h5>
          <p></p>
          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <h5>
            To educate every traveling Albertan with the appropriate health
            information that includes recommended travel vaccinations and
            medication to secure a safe trip as well as to connect you to the
            right travel health professional that will meet your needs in an
            easy and convenient way.

          <h2>Pharmacy Services</h2>
          <h3>What can we do for you?</h3>
          <h5>
            As healthcare providers that are passionate about travel health, we
            have made the effort to create pathways from the patient to your
            front door. With the expanded scope of practice for Pharmacists
            within Alberta, Pharmacists are in a unique position to provide
            Albertan travelers the means of safe travel experience, including
            travel vaccinations, preventative antibiotics and travel advisories.
            We have built relationships with different partners within our
            community that travelers are already seeking the purpose of guiding
            them to your premises in a manner that is convenient for both the
            patient and you.
          </h5>
          <h2>Travel Agent Services</h2>
          <h3>How our services benefit your clients.</h3>
          <h5>
            We recognize that as travel agents your goal is to help your clients
            plan and execute their trips in a manner that exceeds their
            expectations. Through our observation, we have identified a
            potential disconnect between the travel expert and the travel health
            expert that can leave Albertans susceptible to potential health
            risks that overall diminish the travel experience. This disconnect
            is where we have decided to provide support. By connecting your
            clients to necessary health resources we believe your clients will
            have a more memorable and simpler planning experience that we
            believe may translate to more enjoyable travel. Through our easy and
            time efficient program we believe we can help you provide your
            clients with a comprehensive plan to enjoy a fun and safe trip.
